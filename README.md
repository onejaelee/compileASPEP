# compileASPEP
Compiles ASPEP (Annual Survey of Public Employment &amp; Payroll) into DataFrame and csv and joins with Census Bureau Fed, State, and Local Revenue and Expenditure data

ASEP_generator.py is used to clean and convert ASPEP data in ASPEP format into a DataFrame or csv that matches the format of another project that
creates a DataFrame from the Census of Government that pertains to Federal, State, and Local Revenue and Expenditures so that both data sets of
disparate format can be merged to combine government payroll data to government revenue and expenditure data to draw conclusions between
pay of government workers and changes to revenue and expenditure structures (specifically when the government runs a deficit).
